In C++, a structure (also known as a struct) is a user-defined data type that allows you to combine multiple variables of different data types into a single unit. Here's a brief overview:

Declaring a Structure


struct StructureName {
    data_type variable1;
    data_type variable2;
    ...
};


Example


struct Person {
    int age;
    string name;
    float height;
};


Accessing Structure Members


Person person;
person.age = 30;
person.name = "John";
person.height = 5.9;


Key Features

1. Members: Variables within a structure are called members.
2. Data Hiding: Structures can hide their implementation details.
3. Code Reusability: Structures promote code reusability.
4. Memory Efficiency: Structures can reduce memory usage.

Types of Structures

1. Simple Structure: A basic structure with members.
2. Nested Structure: A structure within another structure.
3. Array of Structures: An array of structures.
4. Pointer to Structure: A pointer pointing to a structure.
5. Self-Referential Structure: A structure containing a pointer to itself.

Common Operations

1. Assignment: Assigning values to structure members.
2. Comparison: Comparing structures using operators.
3. Input/Output: Reading and writing structures to files or console.

Best Practices

1. Use meaningful names for structures and members.
2. Keep structures simple and focused.
3. Use access specifiers (public, private, protected) to control access.

By using structures, you can organize data and functions effectively, making your C++ programs more efficient, readable, and maintainable.
