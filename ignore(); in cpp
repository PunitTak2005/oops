In C++, ignore() is a function that ignores a specified number of characters from the input stream. It is often used to skip over unwanted characters or to clear the input buffer.

Here's the syntax:

cin.ignore(int n, char c);

Where:

- n is the number of characters to ignore (default is 1).
- c is the delimiter character (default is EOF, end-of-file).

Example:

cin.ignore(5, '\n'); // ignores the next 5 characters or until a newline is reached

Common use cases:

1. Skipping whitespace: cin.ignore() can be used to skip over whitespace characters, like spaces, tabs, or newlines.
2. Clearing input buffer: cin.ignore(1000, '\n') can be used to clear the input buffer up to 1000 characters or until a newline is reached.
3. Ignoring unwanted input: cin.ignore() can be used to ignore unwanted input, like a newline character left in the input buffer after reading an integer.

Remember to include the <iostream> header file to use ignore().
