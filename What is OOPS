OOPS stands for Object-Oriented Programming Systems, which refers to a programming paradigm that revolves around the concept of objects and classes. This approach to programming emphasizes the organization of data and functionality into reusable and modular units, known as objects, which interact with each other to form a program. The main principles of OOPS include:

1. Encapsulation
2. Abstraction
3. Inheritance
4. Polymorphism

These principles enable developers to create robust, maintainable, and scalable softwareÂ systems.
